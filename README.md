## Program Description

This application provides a graphical to-do list for task management:

1️ **Add Task** – Enter a task in the text field and press the "Add" button or hit Enter to save it in the list  
2️ **Edit Task** – Double-click any task to modify its text  
3️ **Delete Task** – Select a task and click "Delete Selected" (or use the Delete key)  
4️ **Clear All** – Removes all tasks from the list at once  

Tasks are stored temporarily during runtime. This project is ideal for understanding GUI development using Java Swing components such as JFrame,   
JButton, JTextField, and JList.
